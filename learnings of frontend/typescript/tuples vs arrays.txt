In TypeScript, tuples and arrays are both used to handle collections of values, but they have distinct characteristics and use cases. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison:
1. Definition and Structure
   Array:- An array in TypeScript is a collection of elements that are all of the same type. You define it with a type like number[] or string[], where every element in the array is expected to be of that type.
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let names: string[] = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'];

   Tuple:- A tuple is a fixed-size array where each element can be of a different type. Tuples allow you to specify the type and position of each element.

    let person: [string, number] = ['Alice', 30];

2. Element Types
   Array: All elements must be of the same type.

   let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];  // All elements are numbers

   Tuple: Each element can have a different type, and you specify the type for each position.

   let person: [string, number] = ['Alice', 30];  // First element is a string, second is a number

3. Size and Mutability

    Array:- Arrays are dynamic and can change in size. You can add, remove, or modify elements.
    let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
    numbers.push(4);  // [1, 2, 3, 4]

    Tuple: Tuples have a fixed size once defined. Each position in a tuple has a specific type, and the length is fixed. However, you can still modify the values at specific positions.

    let person: [string, number] = ['Alice', 30];
    person[0] = 'Bob';  // ['Bob', 30]

4. Index Signatures

    Array: Arrays can be indexed with numbers, and the type of the element at each index is the same.
    let names: string[] = ['Alice', 'Bob'];
    let firstName = names[0];  // string

    Tuple: Tuples can also be indexed with numbers, but each index has a specific type defined by the tuple's type definition.
    let person: [string, number] = ['Alice', 30];
    let name = person[0];  // string
    let age = person[1];   // number

5. Use Cases
    Array: Use arrays when you have a collection of elements that are of the same type and may vary in number.
    Tuple: Use tuples when you need a fixed-size collection where each element can be of a different type, and you want to enforce a specific structure. Tuples are often used to represent data structures with a fixed format, like function return values or a specific record type.

Example Usage

Array Example:
let scores: number[] = [90, 80, 70];
scores.push(60);  // Adding more scores

Tuple Example:
let person: [string, number] = ['Alice', 30];
let coordinates: [number, number] = [10, 20];  // Coordinates with fixed types

In summary, the key differences lie in the flexibility and type safety of each. Arrays are flexible and homogeneous, while tuples are fixed in size and allow for heterogeneous types.
