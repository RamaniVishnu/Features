can you explain with real time development scenario when to use object, array and set ?
Absolutely! In real-world development, choosing between objects, arrays, and sets depends on the type of data you're working with and how you intend to process it. Let's explore practical scenarios where each is most useful.

ðŸ”¹ When to Use an Object ({})
Use an object when you need structured data with named propertiesâ€”essentially, when you want to store key-value pairs.

ðŸ“Œ Example: User Profile (Backend API)
Imagine you're building an authentication system where user data is stored. An object is ideal because each user has named attributes like name, email, and age.

javascript
let user = {
    id: 101,
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@example.com",
    age: 25
};

// Access user details
console.log(user.name); // Output: John Doe
console.log(user.email); // Output: john@example.com
Real-life use cases: âœ… API responses (user data, product details, configs) âœ… Storing settings or configurations (appConfig.theme = "dark") âœ… Mapping objects with unique identifiers (user.id)

ðŸ”¹ When to Use an Array ([])
Use an array when you need an ordered list of items, where each item doesnâ€™t necessarily need a unique key.

ðŸ“Œ Example: Product List (E-commerce App)
You're designing a shopping cart system, where users add products. Since products need to be listed and accessed by index, an array makes sense.

javascript
let cart = [
    { id: 1, name: "Laptop", price: 1000 },
    { id: 2, name: "Mouse", price: 20 },
    { id: 3, name: "Keyboard", price: 50 }
];

// Get the first item
console.log(cart[0].name); // Output: Laptop
Real-life use cases: âœ… Lists of data (products, users, messages, notifications) âœ… Iterating over elements (forEach, map, filter) âœ… Processing multiple records in order (pagination, results lists)

ðŸ”¹ When to Use a Set (new Set())
Use a Set when you need a collection of unique values, especially when duplicates must be removed.

ðŸ“Œ Example: Tags for a Blog (Content Management System)
A blog system allows users to add tags for posts (like "JavaScript", "Web", "React"). But tags should be uniqueâ€”you donâ€™t want duplicates!

javascript
let tags = new Set(["JavaScript", "React", "Web", "React"]); // Duplicate "React"

console.log(tags); // Output: Set { 'JavaScript', 'React', 'Web' }

// Convert Set to Array
console.log([...tags]); // Output: ['JavaScript', 'React', 'Web']
Real-life use cases: âœ… Filtering out duplicate data (removing duplicate users, orders, comments) âœ… Checking unique values quickly (set.has("React")) âœ… Fast lookup operations (tracking selected filters in UI)

ðŸš€ Which One Should You Use?
Scenario	Best Choice
Store structured data (user profile)	âœ… Object {}
Maintain an ordered list (shopping cart)	âœ… Array []
Keep track of unique values (tags, IDs)	âœ… Set new Set()
If you need both key-value pairs and ordering, sometimes a combination works best! Would you like examples of mixed usage, like an array of objects or a set inside an object?
